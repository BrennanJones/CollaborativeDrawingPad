CollaborativeDrawingPad
=======================

A collaborative drawing pad tool created with client-side HTML5/JavaScript and server-side NodeJS JavaScript.

This drawing tool is based off code by Martin Angelov (http://tutorialzine.com/2012/08/nodejs-drawing-game/). To run this tool, you need NodeJS and you need the following NodeJS packages:

1) socket.io
2) node-static

In the root directory of the source, run the command 'node app.js' to start the server on port 8080. To connect clients, simply open a web browser (with HTML5 and JavaScript support) and connect to localhost:8080 (or [your_ip_address]:8080).

This tool includes some basic functionality, including the ablility for multiple users to draw together on a shared drawing space. The following has been implemented so far:

* Basic drawing
* Change thickness of strokes (does not work as hoped, but still gives a neat effect)
* Ability to see other users drawing and other users' cursors
* Ability to clear the drawing pad
* Server saves the state of the drawing pad, so new clients will be presented with the current state of the drawing pad

Features to implement:

* Eraser
* Multiple colours
* Different style brushes / stroke patterns
* Touch support
* Ability to save images
* Ability to uniquely identify users based on name and cursor colour
